# QNX
API for realtime periodic task runnig over QNX Neutrino
the main aim of this project is to define an API for QNX Neutrino in which we could run periodic tasks in different ways as it would be required in Real-time operating systems and Embedded systems. 
The project has started with:
1- running priodic tasks with different priorities, worst process time and deadlines
2- guarantee tests
3- checking if the deadline of specific task has missed
